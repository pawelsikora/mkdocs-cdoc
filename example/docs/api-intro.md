## Getting Started

This API provides core utilities for working with the engine.
Before using any functions, make sure to call :func:`engine_init`
to set up the required state.

### Quick overview

The library is split into two main modules:

- **Core** (`engine.h`) — initialization, configuration, lifecycle
- **Utils** (`utils.h`) — helper functions and data conversion
