# My Project

Welcome to the project documentation.

The **Core API** and **Driver API** sections in the sidebar are
automatically generated by the cdoc plugin from two separate
source directories (`src/core/` and `src/drivers/`).

The **Test API** section demonstrates IGT test documentation mode,
parsing `TEST:` / `SUBTEST:` structured comments and `igt_subtest()`
calls from `src/tests/`. The "By Category" and "By Mega Feature"
pages are auto-generated from metadata in the test doc comments.

## Manual directive example

You can also embed individual symbols into any hand-written page:

::: c:autofunction
    :file: engine.h
    :name: engine_init

## Cross-reference examples

File references: see :file:`engine.h` for the public API, or qualify
with the group: :file:`core/engine.h` and :file:`drivers/uart.c`.

Backtick auto-linking also works for files: `engine.h`, `core/engine.h`.
